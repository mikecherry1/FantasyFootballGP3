## Fantasy Football Team Manager

---

The goal for this app was to provide a platform on which fantasy football lovers could thrive. We wanted a singular platform that users
could log into to access ALL of their multiple teams, spread across different sources (NFL.com, Yahoo.com, ESPN), as well as their favorite
news characters and platforms. We ended up, due to time constraints, going down a path on which users could add their players one by one,
using our tables. Unfortunately, we also had issues dealing with some of the APIs for these big fantasy football sites, however, we are accessing a large quantity of data that allows users to add
players and compare their states, such as projected rankings and points based off position.

WHAT WE WOULD DO DIFFERENTLY: Use React and MongoDB for authentication. Sequelize and MySQL were pretty difficult to integrate into the
React boilerplate, so I'm sure that there are easier ways to do what we did. Also, we would use something better than vanilla Materialize CSS
for our React components. I would also pursue actually being able to implement a user's existing team data into our app. If a user has an
ESPN fantasy team, then our app would take that info and integrate and reform the team with our template.
